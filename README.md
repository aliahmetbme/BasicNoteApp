# BasicNote App

BasicNote is a simple note-taking application for iOS, designed to help users keep track of their notes in a clean and intuitive interface. This project is built using Swift and follows a programmatic approach for UI development.

## Features

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVVM architecture, which separates the app's logic into distinct layers for better maintainability and scalability:

- **Model**: Contains data models representing the app's core data (e.g., Note).
- **View**: Handles all UI components and layout, presenting data to the user.
- **ViewModel**: Manages the data presentation logic, transforming models into a format suitable for the view.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: A core programming language for iOS development.
- **UIKit**: For building the app's user interface programmatically.
- **SnapKit**: For creating the UI layout programmatically with concise and readable code.
- **Alamofire**: For handling network processes, including API requests.
- **IQKeyboardManager**: For managing keyboard interactions within the app.
- **MVVM Architecture**: To separate concerns and improve code maintainability.
